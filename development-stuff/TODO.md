# TODO

## dunstblick-desktop

- User Interface
	- Collapsing of `exited` applications
- Port the implementation to Wasm

## dunstblick-app

- [ ] Also free the current_event thingy if any. This would dangle if the application would be closed.
- [ ] Implement new SingleInterfaceApplication
      Single application interface that behaves like a connection to the outer world and replicates that behaviour. All connections will see the same data.
- [ ] Rework the C api to use the event-driven API style as well

## dunstblick-display
=> see dunstblick-desktop

## dunstblick-compiler
- [ ] Create a generator for resource info ("bindgen")
