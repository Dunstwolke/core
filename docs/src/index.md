# The Dunstwolke Project

## Introduction

Dunstwolke is a project that tries another approach to a *personal cloud*.
The core idea is to have a decentralized, ad-hoc computer network that
connects several services to a nice personal experience.

What started the project was the following thought:

> Why should my wireless headset be connected uniquely to my laptop / mobile phone?
> If i could connect the headset to all of my personal devices and just mix the audio
> streams on the headset…
>
> I would somehome have to interface with the headset…
>
> And why shouldn't the headset itself play the music and only read the mp3 file
> from a device with storage in local reach?

These thoughts lead to a more complex idea of a system that can access and control
several devices connected into a decentralized network with storage, remote user
interfaces and *floating* applications.

## Prototypes and Concepts

Right now most of the Dunstwolke Project is in early prototype stage or only exists
as a concept:

- [Dunstblick](dunstblick.md)
- [Dunstnetz](dunstnetz.md)
- [DunstFS](dunstfs.md)

## Source Code

The project is written in Zig and is available on GitHub:

## The Name

The name *Dunstwolke* is a portmanteau of the german *Dunstkreis* (a sphere of influence) and *Wolke* (cloud).

Also *Dunst* itself is translated as haze, so it also fits the cloud topic.
